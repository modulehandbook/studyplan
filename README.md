Further information on [docker.com/get-docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker.com/compose/install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
sudo docker-compose build
```
### 4. Start docker container
Run the following command inside the project-directory.
```bash

### 5. Seeding the Database
To set up a test user run (in a second terminal window):

```
## Use the development environment

### Start Docker-Desktop
* If you have docker-desktop installed: Start this first.

* If you have only docker-engine installed: Do nothing.

### Start the environment
```bash
sudo docker-compose up
```
* add ```-d``` flag to run in background
* open App on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (changes will be applied automatically)

### Stop the environment
```bash
sudo docker-compose down
```
### See logs
```bash
sudo docker-compose logs
```

## Additional information
* You may want not always prefix the docker commands with ```sudo```, so look [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
* In ```docker-dev-db``` the local database is stored. To reset remove the directory.
* ```client/.eslintrc.js``` can be ignored.
